Build a restaurant reservation widget
Build a React component that allows users to book a table at a restaurant.
Users should be able to choose the number of persons they want to book for, the date and the time.

Here is the user flow to guide your work:

initially, show just a button with the text "Book a table"
on click, a dialog opens for the user to choose the date, time and number of persons
when the user clicks "Book", he can enter his name and phone number and confirm the reservation;
at the end of the flow, since we don't have a backend endpoint to POST the information to, you can just console.log the booking details
